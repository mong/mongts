## Fact sheets for different patient samples in the COPD Healthcare Atlas

The fact sheets provide a brief description of the patient samples, as well as information about the populationâ€™s use of services in geographical areas (hospital referral areas). The use is measured as the number of events per 10,000 population or as the proportion of patients that receive a certain service. The fact sheets also include brief comments on the variation in use between geographical areas.
