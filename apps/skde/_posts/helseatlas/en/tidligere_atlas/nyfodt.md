## Fact sheets for different patient samples in the Norwegian Neonatal Healthcare Atlas

The fact sheets provide a brief description of the patient samples, as well as information about the populationâ€™s use of services in geographical areas (hospital referral areas). The use is measured as the number of contacts per 100.000 population. The factsheets also include brief comments on the variation in use between geographical areas.
