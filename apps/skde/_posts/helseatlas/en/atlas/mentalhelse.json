Building upon the foundational insights 2020 Healthcare Atlas for Mental Healthcare and Substance Abuse Treatment, this updated atlas offers comprehensive data on treatments for children and adolescents in Norway. COVID-19 pandemic has influenced patterns of morbidity and healthcare activities both during and in the aftermath of the pandemic. The atlas is structured into two main sections: (1) an overview of patients and healthcare activities at an aggregated level, and (2) an analysis of treatments within the principal diagnostic groups in mental healthcare services for children and adolescents. Both sections explore the treatment of mental disorders across various healthcare settings, including mental healthcare services, somatic care, interdisciplinary addiction treatment, and private specialists under public funding contracts.",

It is calculated as the standard deviation of the rates divided by the mean rate, multiplied by 100.  \n\nThe systematic component of variation (SCV) is of particular importance, as it isolates systematic variation and is thus considered the most precise measure of variation in this context. SCV represents the total variation minus random variation across referral areas. For SCV2, the highest and lowest values are excluded to reduce sensitivity to extreme data points. \n\nWe categorize variation levels as follows: SCV less than 3 is small variation, between 3.1-5.4 is moderate variation, between 5.5-10.0 is large variation. SCV values above 3 are likely indicative of practice differences within healthcare services [(Appelby, 2011)](https://assets.kingsfund.org.uk/f/256914/x/2ceabe804f/variations_health_care_good_bad_inexplicable_2011.pdf).[](https://assets.kingsfund.org.uk/f/256914/x/2ceabe804f/variations_health_care_good_bad_inexplicable_2011.pdf)"

          "tekst": "Mental health challenges are common among children and adolescents. Such challenges as depression or anxiety, encompass a spectrum of severity from mild to severe. In contrast, mental disorders are distinguished by a pronounced burden of symptoms and are frequently associated with significant functional impairments ([Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/he/folkehelserapporten/?term=)).  \n\nChildren and adolescents with mental health issues or disorders seek help in both primary and specialist healthcare services. While the treatment of mental disorders typically occurs within specialist healthcare services, general practitioners (GPs) play a critical role in the early identification and management of mental health issues and milder mental disorders. GPs often collaborate with child welfare services and health stations to provide follow-up care. Data on general practitioner activity offers valuable insights into the proportion of children and adolescents engaging with primary healthcare services due to mental health concerns. \n\nMental comorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of multiple mental disorders, is prevalent among children and adolescents. Common combinations include depression with anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with specific developmental disorders. Data from the period 2019–2023 indicates that 30% of children and adolescents receiving outpatient treatment for depression were also treated for anxiety disorders, while 39% of those treated for ADHD were concurrently receiving treatment for specific developmental disorders. \n\nThe presence of comorbidity adds significant complexity to treatment, often challenging care processes and rendering treatment outcomes less predictable ([Roth and Fonagy, 2005](https://www.guilford.com/books/What-Works-for-Whom/Roth-Fonagy/9781593852726?srsltid=AfmBOooif8lGRELH6qri1DKF11VB4ysPm-8lldIUQw7CeLqd0gZ-Fuyh)). The high prevalence of comorbidity among this population underscores its substantial influence on variations in patient needs and clinical practices, highlighting its critical importance in the planning and provision of mental healthcare services."

Nationwide, approximately 16% of outpatient activity is attributed to the somatic healthcare sector; however, this proportion exhibits considerable regional variation, ranging from 9% to 24% across different referral areas. \n\nThere is low geographical variation in the patient rate. However, patients residing in the Helgeland, Finnmark, UNN, and Førde referral areas exhibit significantly higher rates compared to other regions. Conversely, Vestre Viken reports a markedly lower patient rate, while the remaining referral areas with low rates demonstrate comparatively smaller differences. \n\nWhile geographical variation in patient rates is relatively small, temporal changes during the period from 2018 to 2023 are more pronounced. Nationwide, the number of patients increased by approximately 20%. This trend was observed across all referral areas except Vestfold, with the highest rates reported in Ahus, Østfold, Bergen, and Finnmark. \n\nA high patient rate reflects an elevated number of children and adolescents receiving outpatient treatment relative to the same population age in the area; however, this metric does not account for the intensity of care provided. as we include a single count per patient per year, irrespective of the number of consultations. Variations in service delivery are evident, as some referral areas primarily focus on periodic check-ups for patients whose conditions have improved, while others may not adopt similar practices.

Patients in the Telemark and Helgeland referral areas have the highest number of outpatient contact days, while Møre og Romsdal has the lowest rate. \n\nWe used the number of contact days rather than outpatient contacts as a measure of activity. This choice is based on the observation that the number of outpatient contacts per patient can vary substantially within a single day across different referral areas. Contact days serve as a more consistent measure of activity, aligning better with resource allocation models that utilize activity-based funding. \n\nWhile the number of contacts in mental healthcare, interdisciplinary specialized addiction treatment, and contracted specialists in mental healthcare remained stable from 2014 to 2018 [(Bale et al., 2020)](https://apps.skde.no/helseatlas/v2/psyk/) a nationwide increase in the number of contact days has been observed since then. This trend is evident in many referral areas; however, Sørlandet, Ahus, and Stavanger do not follow this pattern. There are notable differences in the number of contact days per patient. For example, referral areas such as OUS, Vestre Viken, Telemark, and Bergen average approximately 13 contact days per patient, while Nord-Trøndelag, Førde, St. Olav, and Finnmark report closer to 10. These variations are significant and are likely influenced by differences in how services are organized across regions. \n\nHowever, the use of contact days may mask variations in treatment intensity across referral areas, particularly when considering practices during a single day. For example, a patient may have contact with multiple therapists on the same day.
