Building upon the foundational insights 2020 Healthcare Atlas for Mental Healthcare and Substance Abuse Treatment, this updated atlas offers comprehensive data on treatments for children and adolescents in Norway. COVID-19 pandemic has influenced patterns of morbidity and healthcare activities both during and in the aftermath of the pandemic. The atlas is structured into two main sections: (1) an overview of patients and healthcare activities at an aggregated level, and (2) an analysis of treatments within the principal diagnostic groups in mental healthcare services for children and adolescents. Both sections explore the treatment of mental disorders across various healthcare settings, including mental healthcare services, somatic care, interdisciplinary addiction treatment, and private specialists under public funding contracts.",

Although there are moderate variations in activity between referral areas, a significantly higher proportion of boys than girls receive treatment for these conditions. \n* Considerable geographical variation is observed for patients receiving treatment for depression."

While ratio 2, EQ2, reflects the relationship between the second highest and the second lowest rate. Higher ratios indicate greater variation between referral areas. \n\nThe coefficient of variation, CV, provides a more comprehensive measure of variation among referral areas. It is calculated as the standard deviation of the rates divided by the mean rate, multiplied by 100.  \n\nThe systematic component of variation (SCV) is of particular importance, as it isolates systematic variation and is thus considered the most precise measure of variation in this context. SCV represents the total variation minus random variation across referral areas. For SCV2, the highest and lowest values are excluded to reduce sensitivity to extreme data points. \n\nWe categorize variation levels as follows: SCV less than 3 is small variation, between 3.1-5.4 is moderate variation, between 5.5-10.0 is large variation. SCV values above 3 are likely indicative of practice differences within healthcare services [(Appelby, 2011)](https://assets.kingsfund.org.uk/f/256914/x/2ceabe804f/variations_health_care_good_bad_inexplicable_2011.pdf).[](https://assets.kingsfund.org.uk/f/256914/x/2ceabe804f/variations_health_care_good_bad_inexplicable_2011.pdf)"

          "tekst": "Mental health challenges are common among children and adolescents. Such challenges as depression or anxiety, encompass a spectrum of severity from mild to severe. In contrast, mental disorders are distinguished by a pronounced burden of symptoms and are frequently associated with significant functional impairments ([Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/he/folkehelserapporten/?term=)).  \n\nChildren and adolescents with mental health issues or disorders seek help in both primary and specialist healthcare services. While the treatment of mental disorders typically occurs within specialist healthcare services, general practitioners (GPs) play a critical role in the early identification and management of mental health issues and milder mental disorders. GPs often collaborate with child welfare services and health stations to provide follow-up care. Data on general practitioner activity offers valuable insights into the proportion of children and adolescents engaging with primary healthcare services due to mental health concerns. \n\nMental comorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of multiple mental disorders, is prevalent among children and adolescents. Common combinations include depression with anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with specific developmental disorders. Data from the period 2019–2023 indicates that 30% of children and adolescents receiving outpatient treatment for depression were also treated for anxiety disorders, while 39% of those treated for ADHD were concurrently receiving treatment for specific developmental disorders. \n\nThe presence of comorbidity adds significant complexity to treatment, often challenging care processes and rendering treatment outcomes less predictable ([Roth and Fonagy, 2005](https://www.guilford.com/books/What-Works-for-Whom/Roth-Fonagy/9781593852726?srsltid=AfmBOooif8lGRELH6qri1DKF11VB4ysPm-8lldIUQw7CeLqd0gZ-Fuyh)). The high prevalence of comorbidity among this population underscores its substantial influence on variations in patient needs and clinical practices, highlighting its critical importance in the planning and provision of mental healthcare services."
