Building upon the foundational insights 2020 Healthcare Atlas for Mental Healthcare and Substance Abuse Treatment, this updated atlas offers comprehensive data on treatments for children and adolescents in Norway. COVID-19 pandemic has influenced patterns of morbidity and healthcare activities both during and in the aftermath of the pandemic. The atlas is structured into two main sections: (1) an overview of patients and healthcare activities at an aggregated level, and (2) an analysis of treatments within the principal diagnostic groups in mental healthcare services for children and adolescents. Both sections explore the treatment of mental disorders across various healthcare settings, including mental healthcare services, somatic care, interdisciplinary addiction treatment, and private specialists under public funding contracts.",

SCV represents the total variation minus random variation across referral areas. For SCV2, the highest and lowest values are excluded to reduce sensitivity to extreme data points. \n\nWe categorize variation levels as follows: SCV less than 3 is small variation, between 3.1-5.4 is moderate variation, between 5.5-10.0 is large variation. SCV values above 3 are likely indicative of practice differences within healthcare services [(Appelby, 2011)](https://assets.kingsfund.org.uk/f/256914/x/2ceabe804f/variations_health_care_good_bad_inexplicable_2011.pdf).[](https://assets.kingsfund.org.uk/f/256914/x/2ceabe804f/variations_health_care_good_bad_inexplicable_2011.pdf)"

          "tekst": "Mental health challenges are common among children and adolescents. Such challenges as depression or anxiety, encompass a spectrum of severity from mild to severe. In contrast, mental disorders are distinguished by a pronounced burden of symptoms and are frequently associated with significant functional impairments ([Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/he/folkehelserapporten/?term=)).  \n\nChildren and adolescents with mental health issues or disorders seek help in both primary and specialist healthcare services. While the treatment of mental disorders typically occurs within specialist healthcare services, general practitioners (GPs) play a critical role in the early identification and management of mental health issues and milder mental disorders. GPs often collaborate with child welfare services and health stations to provide follow-up care. Data on general practitioner activity offers valuable insights into the proportion of children and adolescents engaging with primary healthcare services due to mental health concerns. \n\nMental comorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of multiple mental disorders, is prevalent among children and adolescents. Common combinations include depression with anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with specific developmental disorders. Data from the period 2019–2023 indicates that 30% of children and adolescents receiving outpatient treatment for depression were also treated for anxiety disorders, while 39% of those treated for ADHD were concurrently receiving treatment for specific developmental disorders. \n\nThe presence of comorbidity adds significant complexity to treatment, often challenging care processes and rendering treatment outcomes less predictable ([Roth and Fonagy, 2005](https://www.guilford.com/books/What-Works-for-Whom/Roth-Fonagy/9781593852726?srsltid=AfmBOooif8lGRELH6qri1DKF11VB4ysPm-8lldIUQw7CeLqd0gZ-Fuyh)). The high prevalence of comorbidity among this population underscores its substantial influence on variations in patient needs and clinical practices, highlighting its critical importance in the planning and provision of mental healthcare services."

Nationwide, approximately 16% of outpatient activity is attributed to the somatic healthcare sector; however, this proportion exhibits considerable regional variation, ranging from 9% to 24% across different referral areas. \n\nThere is low geographical variation in the patient rate. However, patients residing in the Helgeland, Finnmark, UNN, and Førde referral areas exhibit significantly higher rates compared to other regions. Conversely, Vestre Viken reports a markedly lower patient rate, while the remaining referral areas with low rates demonstrate comparatively smaller differences. \n\nWhile geographical variation in patient rates is relatively small, temporal changes during the period from 2018 to 2023 are more pronounced. Nationwide, the number of patients increased by approximately 20%. This trend was observed across all referral areas except Vestfold, with the highest rates reported in Ahus, Østfold, Bergen, and Finnmark. \n\nA high patient rate reflects an elevated number of children and adolescents receiving outpatient treatment relative to the same population age in the area; however, this metric does not account for the intensity of care provided. as we include a single count per patient per year, irrespective of the number of consultations. Variations in service delivery are evident, as some referral areas primarily focus on periodic check-ups for patients whose conditions have improved, while others may not adopt similar practices.

Patients in the Telemark and Helgeland referral areas have the highest number of outpatient contact days, while Møre og Romsdal has the lowest rate. \n\nWe used the number of contact days rather than outpatient contacts as a measure of activity. This choice is based on the observation that the number of outpatient contacts per patient can vary substantially within a single day across different referral areas. Contact days serve as a more consistent measure of activity, aligning better with resource allocation models that utilize activity-based funding. \n\nWhile the number of contacts in mental healthcare, interdisciplinary specialized addiction treatment, and contracted specialists in mental healthcare remained stable from 2014 to 2018 [(Bale et al., 2020)](https://apps.skde.no/helseatlas/v2/psyk/) a nationwide increase in the number of contact days has been observed since then. This trend is evident in many referral areas; however, Sørlandet, Ahus, and Stavanger do not follow this pattern. There are notable differences in the number of contact days per patient. For example, referral areas such as OUS, Vestre Viken, Telemark, and Bergen average approximately 13 contact days per patient, while Nord-Trøndelag, Førde, St. Olav, and Finnmark report closer to 10. These variations are significant and are likely influenced by differences in how services are organized across regions. \n\nHowever, the use of contact days may mask variations in treatment intensity across referral areas, particularly when considering practices during a single day. For example, a patient may have contact with multiple therapists on the same day.

The referrals exceeded the capacity of the services, resulting in prolonged waiting periods for treatment. \n\nThe intensity of treatment (care) is clinically pertinent for certain mental health diagnoses. The following analysis focuses on patients receiving outpatient care for anxiety disorders, depression, and eating disorders, with one documented contact during their treatment pathway. The analysis encompasses the duration of the treatment course, which is measured in the same year as the referral. As the referral date frequently constitutes a component of the treatment course for the majority of patients, the year 2022 is the last year for the figure to be comparable. \n\nThe table presents the median number of days from the date of referral to the initial contact (column 1), followed by the median number of days between the second, third, fourth, and fifth contact dates and the referral date. The columns displaying the 6th to 11th dates of contact and the 11th to 15th dates of contact illustrate the median values for the intervals between the contacts. The difference between the average intervals for the 3rd to 15th dates of contact and the 0th to 15th dates of contact indicates the relative intensity of care from the 3rd contact onwards, compared to the overall intensity across the entire treatment course leading up to the 15th contacts. \n\nThe median is used to analyze waiting time when all referral periods are sorted in ascending order. Furthermore, the median offers a more representative measure of the typical treatment intensity—and frequency of care—experienced by patients across different referral areas. \n\n\n\n\n\n![](/helseatlas/img/en/mentalhelse/median_intensitet_kontakt5_15_kompakt_trafikklys_eng-004-.png)\n\n\n\n\nA significant disparity in waiting times was observed across different referral areas. The longest waiting time are exhibited by St. Olavs, Nordland, and Finnmark throughout the study period, while patients in Vestfold experienced waiting times that were less than half the duration of those in the St. Olavs referral area. The data presented in the columns on the right reveal that Førde, Fonna, and Finnmark had longer intervals between each care contact compared to other referral areas. Additionally, UNN, Nord-Trøndelag, Finnmark, and St. Olavs exhibited slightly higher values for the second contact. \n\nThe discrepancy between the two measures of treatment pathway intensity underscores the variation across referral areas in terms of patient progression along the treatment course. A substantial difference suggests a delay in patients' access to timely healthcare, whereas a small difference indicates more consistent planning and treatment scheduling throughout the course of the treatment. UNN, Bergen, Sørlandet, and Vestfold exhibited lower variances, displaying a parallel trend in both waiting times and treatment intensity. Notably, UNN deviates from this pattern, with a higher median waiting time for the third patient contact with healthcare, although the overall duration of the course of care remains comparatively brief. Conversely, Førde demonstrated relatively low treatment intensity, with shorter waiting times compensating for the reduced intensity over time. \n\nSt. Olavs is characterized by prolonged waiting times, extended waiting intervals to the second patient visit, and a failure to reduce time gaps throughout the subsequent treatment course up to 15th visit. Finnmark and Nord-Trøndelag demonstrate similar patterns. Conversely, OUS, despite long waiting times, maintains the highest treatment intensity of all referral areas at the outset of the treatment course."

Lovisenberg stands out with a markedly higher rate compared to other referral areas, while several regions report around 80 contact days per 1,000 population.

For the country overall, and for many referral areas, the contact day rate in 2023 was lower than in previous years. \n\nAs previously noted, many children and adolescents with anxiety disorders also have comorbid mental health conditions, with ADHD and depression being the most prevalent. ADHD demonstrates the greatest variation in comorbidity rates across referral areas, while developmental disorders, although less common, still show significant variation between regions. In particular, children and adolescents in Nordland with anxiety disorders have the highest overall comorbidity, while those in Førde, Sørlandet, and Telemark exhibit among the lowest rates. \n\nA significant difference in the number of contact days per patient was also observed.

The disparity between these SCVs can be attributed primarily to Nordland, which exhibited a significantly higher patient rate compared to other referral areas. Therefore, both SCV measures should be considered when assessing geographical variation. Additionally, other areas in Helse Nord and most referral areas in Helse Vest showed elevated rates.  \n\nComorbidity is particularly prominent between ADHD and specific developmental disorders within child and adolescent mental healthcare services.

A substantial proportion of treatment for specific developmental disorders occurred within somatic healthcare services. For instance, in the Sørlandet referral area, approximately 20% of patients were treated in somatics, while Nord-Trøndelag also had a notable proportion at approximately 15%. \n\nNationwide, the rate of contact days increased significantly, with many referral areas showing substantial growth. Telemark, Nord-Trøndelag, Lovisenberg, Diakonhjemmet, and Bergen experienced approximately a doubling of their contact day rates over the five-year period. Furthermore, several other referral areas reported increases exceeding 50%. \n\nSignificant geographical variation was evident in the rate of contact days, with SCV of 9.6. For example, Nordland demonstrated more than three times the contact day rate compared to Diakonhjemmet, which had the lowest rate. Geographical variation in contact day rates was significant, but referral areas also exhibited different patterns of temporal development. Regions such as Finnmark, Helgeland, Østfold, and Stavanger showed more modest increases compared to other areas. Based on available data, there is no evidence to suggest that these geographical differences are unwarranted. \n\nThe number of contact days per patient also varied by referral area. Lovisenberg, Bergen, and OUS recorded the highest annual number of contact days per patient, although among these, only Bergen had a particularly high overall contact day rate. In contrast, OUS and Lovisenberg had relatively high contact days distributed across a smaller patient group. Notably, specific developmental disorders tend to have fewer contact days per patient compared to other mental disorders. \n\nAs previously noted, differences in diagnostic practices are more thoroughly documented for ADHD than for other mental disorders ([Widding-Havneraas et al., 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00787-022-01996-7); [Surén et al., 2012](https://tidsskriftet.no/2018/11/originalartikkel/diagnostikk-av-hyperkinetisk-forstyrrelse-hos-barn-i-norge)). Given the high rate of comorbidity between specific developmental disorders and ADHD, also considering the larger size of the ADHD patient group, these diagnoses should be evaluated together, as comorbidity may drive higher contact day rates. The observed geographical trends in contact day rates reflect these comorbidity patterns. Except for Helgeland, the five referral areas with the highest contact day rates for specific developmental disorders also exhibit high rates for ADHD. \n\n* St. Olavs' rate for 2023 does not reflect the outpatient activity for that year.
