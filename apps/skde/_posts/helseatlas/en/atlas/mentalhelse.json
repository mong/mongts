Building upon the foundational insights 2020 Healthcare Atlas for Mental Healthcare and Substance Abuse Treatment, this updated atlas offers comprehensive data on treatments for children and adolescents in Norway. COVID-19 pandemic has influenced patterns of morbidity and healthcare activities both during and in the aftermath of the pandemic. The atlas is structured into two main sections: (1) an overview of patients and healthcare activities at an aggregated level, and (2) an analysis of treatments within the principal diagnostic groups in mental health services for children and adolescents. Both sections explore the treatment of mental disorders across various healthcare settings, including mental health services, somatic care, interdisciplinary addiction treatment, and private specialists under public funding contracts.",

Although there are moderate variations in activity between referral areas, a significantly higher proportion of boys than girls receive treatment for these conditions. \n* Considerable geographical variation is observed for patients receiving treatment for depression."
