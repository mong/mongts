          "tekst": "An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) gives detailed images of the body’s internal organs and structures without emitting ionized rays ¬as in the case of X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan.  In general, MRI can distinguish between the different types of soft tissues better than CT and ultrasound.  MRI is therefore more widely used for examinations of conditions in the brain and central nervous system, as well as in investigations of the locomotor system with muscles, tendons, bones and joints.  MRI is also widely used for organs in the abdominal and thoracic cavity."

          "resultat": "There was a 5% increase in the national examination rate from 2018 to 2022.  The total reimbursements from the government to the service providers for MRI examinations during the same period was increased by 14%.  In 2022, the reimbursement was 393 million Norwegian kroner.  \n\nThere were 40% more outpatient MRI examinations (per 10,000 population) performed on residents in referral area Fonna compared with referral area Førde. If all referral areas had the same rate as the area with the highest rate (1,282 per 10,000 population), then there would have been 81,000 more MRI examinations annually, or 13% higher than observed.  This equates to an increase of 49 million kroner in health reimbursements, calculated using the average reimbursement in 2022 at the rate of 610 kroner per examination.\n\nOn the other hand, if all referral areas had the same rate as the area with the lowest rate (911 per 10,000 population), then there would have been 118,000 fewer examinations annually, or 19% lower than observed.  Annual reimbursement would be reduced by 72 million kroner.\n\n**Age and gender**\n\nThe proportion of the population that received an MRI in an outpatient clinic increased with age. The increase is more pronounced for women than for men.  Up to the age of 70, there is a higher percentage of women than men that received MRI.  After that the proportion that received MRI is the same for both genders.\n\n**Historical trend**\n\nThe trend figure above shows that the monthly number of outpatient MRI during the years 2021-2022 was higher than the prior years.  There is an observable effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 where the number of MRI was lower from March to May.  After the summer, the number of MRI returned to the same level as the corresponding period in the years 2018-2019.\n\nA comparison with the National Audit Office's report of imaging examinations in the years 2012–2015 shows that the general usage of the MRI in outpatient clinics has somewhat reduced.  The average annual rate was 1,196 per 10,000 population during 2012-2015 compared to 1,126 per 10,000 population during 2018-2022.\n\n**Remarks**\n\nMRI is an advanced imaging technology that can distinguish different types of tissues and describe the internal organs better than most other types of examinations.  It is often an essential and necessary part of the medical investigation or treatment plan. However, an MRI examination may consist of many images and require a lot of resources in the form of access to highly skilled health professionals, time and equipment. There is also a potential risk that patients may be subjected to unnecessary further examination or treatment, based on incidental findings with little clinical importance. Reducing MRI examinations that provide little or no benefits ensures that the valuable resources are freed up for patients who need it most without long wait time.\n\nIn this atlas we present the consequences of an increase or decrease in the cost of government reimbursements should the rate in all referral areas across the country be the same, i.e., either equal to the highest or the lowest observed rate.  This does not necessarily mean that either of these are the desired level.  For many types of MRI examinations, it is difficult to conclude if the observed variation is a sign of over- or underuse without further information such as the reason for the examination, or activities within the healthcare services before and after the examination.  Information on the use of healthcare services before and after the examination is available for some of the examinations we have included in the atlas (shoulder, knee, and prostate) but not all. Moreover, it is also a challenge to deduce the reasonable level of usage of the imaging services when we do not have trustworthy information about the referrer (GP, private specialist, or hospital).\n\nOverall, there are small to moderate geographical variations in the usage of MRI examinations in outpatient services in Norway.  However, since the total volume of activities is high, the negative consequences such as waste of resources and the unnecessary stress put on the patients are still significant.  It is probable that some of the observed variation is due to different medical practices, or differences in the availability of medical equipment or human resources.",

Brain MRI was the most frequently performed MRI examination in the period 2018–2022 and accounted for 19% of annual outpatient MRI examinations. Total reimbursement from the government to the service providers in 2022 amounted to 86 million kroner.\n\n50% more Brain MRI were carried out per 10,000 population for residents in the referral area Østfold compared to referral area Finnmark. If all referral areas had a rate equal to the highest, 243 per 10,000 population, then 17,100 more examinations would have been carried out nationally, an increase of 15%, over one year. This corresponds to an increase of 12 million kroner in reimbursements, given the average reimbursement of 705 kroner per examination in 2022.\n\nOn the other hand, if all referral areas had the lowest rate, 162 per 10,000 population, then 26,000 fewer examinations would be carried out nationally, a reduction of 23%, over one year. Annual reimbursement would have been reduced by 18.4 million kroner.\n\n**Age and gender**\n\nIn total, there were 440,000 unique patients who underwent a brain MRI examination during the five-year study period of 2018-2022. There were almost twice as many women as men, especially in the 15-55 age group. It is likely that part of the explanation is due to headaches and migraines, which occur more frequently in women.  Most of the patients (84%) only had one brain MRI in the five-year period. 11% had two, and 5% had three or more brain MRI. There was little variation in the proportion of patients who had multiple examinations between the referral areas.\n\n**Historical trend**\n\nThe trend figure shows that the monthly number of outpatient brain MRI in the years 2021–2022 was higher than in previous years. A pandemic effect is observed in 2020, where the number of brain MRI performed was lower in March to May. After the summer, the number of examinations per month in 2020 was roughly at the same level as the corresponding period in the years 2018–2019.\n\nA comparison with the National Audit Office's report of imaging examinations in the years 2012–2015 shows that the average rate for outpatient brain MRI remains unchanged, and neither has the geographical variation.\n\n**Remarks**\n\nThere was geographical variation in the number of outpatient brain MRI performed across the referral areas. Since the total volume is quite high, even a small variation can be significant.\n\nHowever, many brain MRIs are also performed on inpatients.  As an example, for residents of referral areas within the Northern Norway regional health trust, inpatients accounted for 30% of all brain MRI examinations. This makes it difficult to assess whether the observed variation in the use of outpatient brain MRIs is a result of different medical practices.\n\nFurthermore, there are many different indications for brain MRI. There are professional guidelines that recommend the use of MRI, for example for dementia investigations, where both CT and MRI are mentioned, but MRI is preferred.\n\nIn order to assess whether there is overuse or underuse of outpatient brain MRI, more information is needed. SKDE will therefore apply for access to additional data for the activities in the specialist and primary healthcare service before and after a brain MRI and report the findings at a later date.",

Total reimbursements in 2022 for these patients amounted to 15.8 million kroner.\n\nDegenerative changes increase with age, and the interpretation of abnormalities on MRI images can be difficult because structural changes are common for people without symptoms. Recommendations from the National Professional Guideline for Diagnostic Imaging in Non-traumatic Musculoskeletal Disorders (2014) (LINK!) states that diagnostic imaging is rarely needed in the case of non-traumatic shoulder pain. The guideline does not specify an age limit, but SKDE has chosen to analyze ages 50 years and older as a discretionary assessment since degenerative disorders increase with age.\n\nIn the case of chronic shoulder pain, conventional X-rays can detect osteoarthritis. We found that for those over the age of 50 who have had shoulder MRI examinations, 21% had a shoulder X-ray taken within a year prior to the MRI. There was considerable geographical variation. Residents in referral area Finnmark had the highest proportion at 54%, compared to residents in the referral area Fonna at only 14%. The referral areas with the highest proportion of X-rays before MRI are among the referral areas with the lowest proportion of examinations carried out in private clinics.  While there was no significant correlation between the rate for shoulder MRI and the proportion performed in private clinics, it is possible that capacity can be a factor in which imaging method is preferred.\n\nThe indication for surgical intervention in the shoulder for patients over 50 is limited. Common indications may include repairing a damage to the rotator cuff after conservative treatment or inserting a prosthesis in advanced osteoarthritis. The decision-making forum  at the Norwegian institute of Public Health (LINK) recently concluded that in the case of degenerative rotator cuff rupture, non-surgical treatment should be the first choice, as there was little to no effect of surgery compared to conservative treatment.\n\nWe found that only a small proportion, 1% (approx. 300), of the shoulder MRI examinations in patients over 50 were followed by the insertion of a shoulder prosthesis or osteotomy within one year. Furthermore, there were 9% (approx. 3,270) where the examination was followed by other surgical intervention in the shoulder within one year. There was large geographical variation and the ratio between the highest and lowest rate was more than 5.\n\nBased on this, it can be interpreted that few of the shoulder MRI in patients over 50 have a clinical and treatment consequence. The examinations without clinical consequences can therefore be considered to have minimal health benefits and represent overdiagnosis.",
