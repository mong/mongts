For detailed information about the hospital referral areas, please see here (link).\n\nThe atlas is divided into a number of sub-publications. The first part of the radiology atlas is for MRI examinations of the brain, shoulder, hand, prostate, and knee.  Moreover, we analyze only examinations that were performed at out-patient clinics.  Sub-publications of other examinations and modalities will be available at a later date.\n\nResults from a specific referral area can be highlighted in all figures by clicking on the corresponding referral area on one of the figures.",
