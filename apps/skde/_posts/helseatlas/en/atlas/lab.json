            "resultat": "**What is medical biochemistry?**\n\nMedical biochemistry encompasses the study of biochemical, physiological and cellular processes in the human organism. Biochemical analyses can measure components of various materials such as blood (serum, plasma and whole blood). \n\nSome tests can detect the presence of a specific disease with great accuracy, but many tests are very unspecific, and abnormal values alone can not be used as indications of a disease, or the cause of any disease. Often several analyses are performed simultaneously to make the diagnosis of the patient's condition more accurate. \n\n**Results**\n\n In our data, we find that more than 10.5 million biochemical samples were taken annually from 4.3 million patients. Each sample can consist of one or more analyses (e.g. vitamin D, vitamin B12 and folate), and of those 10.5 million samples, just over 100 million analyses were performed. Nationally, 4% of the analyses were analyzed at a GP’s office, while the proportions of analyses analyzed at private and public laboratories were 34% and 62% respectively. \n\n The number of tests per 1,000 inhabitants (rate) varied considerably between hospital referral areas. The highest number of tests per 1,000 inhabitants was performed in South-Eastern Norway, where the rate was 44% higher than in Northern Norway, which had the lowest rate. 76% more tests were performed on residents in Vestfold hospital referral area compared with Finnmark hospital referral area. The average number of tests per sample varied from 5.9 for residents in Finnmark hospital referral area to just over 11 for residents in Vestfold, Diakonhjemmet and OUS hospital referral areas. As with the other results, the number of analyses per sample is gender- and age-adjusted, and the differences are therefore not due to different gender and age distributions in the hospital referral areas. \n\nSince the figures do not include samples taken from patients admitted to hospital, it is possible that different distributions between outpatient clinics and admissions in the hospital referral areas may affect the results somewhat. However, since outpatient activity and the use of GPs are far greater in scope than the use of admissions, this is not thought to have a decisive impact on the results. \n\n**Age and gender**\n\nThe linechart above shows the proportion of the population for each age and gender who have had a sample analyzed in a laboratory v.s. those analyzed directly at the GP's office. Note that the reason for this division in the figure is that data on samples analyzed at the laboratory and samples analyzed at the GP's office could not be linked. Therefore the sum of the two could result in double counting, which artificially inflate the perception. \n\nThe proportion of the population having biochemical samples taken generally increases with increasing age, but the proportion fluctuates somewhat in the different age groups. Over 40% of children aged 1 year received at least one sample per year (most commonly CRP) that was analyzed at the GP's office. For children aged 9, this proportion fell to 20%, before rising to around 40% for both women and men in their 70s. \n\n50% of the female population in their 20s had at least one biochemical sample analyzed in a laboratory. The corresponding proportion for men was approximately 25%. The differences between women and men narrowed towards the end of the 30s, but did not even out until around the age of 60.",

Increased PSA is seen in diseases of the prostate, such as prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or inflammatory conditions (prostatitis) (source: [Metodebok](https://metodebok.no/)).\n\nAccording to Cancer in Norway (2023), more than 60,000 people are living with prostate cancer in Norway, and the incidence of new patients is about 5,500 per year. The PSA test will be used in the assessment and follow-up of symptomatic diseases from the prostate and in cases of clinical suspicion of prostate cancer, as well as in follow-up after treatment of prostate cancer. The test is also used as an annual screening for men in the age group 40-70 years with an increased genetic risk of prostate cancer.\n\n**Results**\n\n In the period 2021-2023, just over 600,000 PSA tests were performed annually on approximately 400,000 men aged 35-105 years in Norway. The number of PSA tests varied considerably between hospital referral areas. The highest number of tests per 1,000 men was performed in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, where the rate was almost 40% higher than in the other three regions. Twice as many PSA tests per 1,000 men were taken annually from residents of Østfold hospital referral area compared with residents of Finnmark hospital referral area. If all hospital referral areas had the same rate as Østfold, more than 200,000 more PSA tests would have been taken per year, which would have led to an increase in reimbursement from Helfo of around NOK 5 million. \n\n**Age**\n\nHalf of those diagnosed with prostate cancer in the period 2018-2022 were 70 years or older. Men under the age of 60 account for approximately 13% of the incidence of prostate cancer in Norway (Cancer Registry of Norway). However, in our analyses, 26% of PSA tests were performed on people under the age of 60. Norway does not have a screening program for prostate cancer for people without an increased genetic risk of prostate cancer, but it is possible that the PSA test is used for screening to some extent.\n\n**Repeat tests**\n\n About 17% of the PSA tests taken were repeat tests taken  within a shorter than recommended interval, i.e. about 99,000 tests are taken per year less than 12 weeks after the patient's last PSA test. The proportion varied from 13% for residents in the Fonna referral area to 19% for residents in the Østfold referral area.",

Production is greatest in intestinal tissue, and CEA is therefore particularly used as a tumor marker for colorectal cancer. Bowel cancer is the second most common form of cancer in Norway. According to Cancer in Norway (2023), approximately 50,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer (prevalence) and there are about 5,000 new cases each year (incidence). There are few benign diseases that result in high CEA values. At the time of diagnosis, approximately half of the patients have elevated CEA. CEA can therefore not be used for screening. The blood test is used for regular monitoring/follow-up of patients with bowel cancer. Checks can be carried out by a GP or in hospital. \n\n**Results**\n\nIn the period 2021-2023, 130,000 CEA tests were performed annually on approximately 85,000 people in Norway. Considering that the test is not suitable for screening, these are high figures. The number of CEA tests per capita varied greatly between hospital referral areas. Most samples were taken in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority and the Western Norway Regional Health Authority, where the rates were 80% higher than in the Northern Norway Regional Health Authority, which had the lowest rate. Annually, 3.5 times as many CEA samples per 1,000 inhabitants were taken from residents in the Fonna hospital referral area compared with the UNN hospital referral area. If all hospital referral areas had the same rate as Fonna, 70% more samples would have been taken, which corresponds to just under 100,000 more CEA samples per year. This would have led to an annual increase in reimbursement from Helfo of approximately NOK 3.3 million.\n\nThere are no known geographical differences in either the prevalence or survival of bowel cancer in Norway, and this cannot therefore explain the differences in the use of CEA tests.  \n\n**Age**\n\n75% of patients are in the 60-84 age group when diagnosed with bowel cancer. In our analyses, we found that around 60% of CEA samples were taken from people in the 60-84 age group, while just over 30% of samples were taken from people under the age of 60 and 10% of samples were taken from people aged 85 or older. \n\n**Repeat samples**\n\nAbout 24% of the CEA samples taken were repeat samples taken at intervals shorter than  recommended, i.e. approximately 32,000 samples per year are taken less than 12 weeks after the patient's last CEA. The proportion varied from 15% for residents in the Østfold hospital referral area to 35% for residents in the Sørlandet hospital referral area.",

Most pathological processes here can result in increased serum levels, such as liver failure, heart failure, peritonitis or tumor disease spreading to the abdominal or pleural cavity. CA125 levels increase in most people with ovarian cancer, but also in some benign gynecological conditions such as endometriosis and myomas and therefore cannot be used as a screening test. According to the Norwegian national user manual for biochemistry, the use of this test should be limited to the investigation of pelvic tumors and follow-up of ovarian cancer. Approximately 7,000 CA125 samples are taken annually from men. The analysis taken on men is assumed to have a different indication than ovarian cancer.\n\nAccording to Cancer in Norway, just over 5,000 women are living with ovarian cancer in Norway, and there were just over 500 new cases in 2023. The Choosing Wisely campaign does not recommend the use of tumor markers when there is no known cancer, specific suspicion of a particular cancer type or a strong, underlying predisposition.\n\n**Results**\n\nIn the period 2021-2023, approximately 78,000 CA125 tests were performed annually on about 55,000 women in Norway. There was great variation in the number of CA125 tests between hospital referral areas.  Most samples were taken in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, where the rate was over 70% higher than in the Northern Norway Regional Health Authority, which had the lowest rate. Almost three times as many CA125 samples were taken annually per 1,000 women living in Fonna hospital referral area compared with Finnmark hospital referral area.  There are no known differences in the incidence of ovarian cancer in Norway, so this cannot explain the differences in the use of CA125 samples. \n\nIf all hospital referral areas had the same rate as Fonna, 47% more samples would have been taken, corresponding to approximately 36,000 additional CA-125 samples nationally each year. This would have led to an annual increase in reimbursements from Helfo of approximately NOK 1.4 million. \n\n**Age**\n\nOvarian cancer is a disease that mainly affects women over the age of 50, but in rare cases younger women can get the disease. Only 4% of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are under the age of 40 at the time of diagnosis, while in our analyses this age group accounted for 16% of all CA125 samples. The median age of diagnosis of ovarian cancer is 68 years, while the median age of CA125 samples in our analyses was 57 years.",

The test result is interpreted manually by the laboratory doctor, and this is therefore a resource-intensive analysis for the laboratory.\n\nProtein electrophoresis is mainly done on suspicion or follow-up of multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer), but also in the diagnosis and control of Waldenström's disease, amyloidosis or other monoclonal disease (MGUS, monoclonal component of uncertain significance) that must be controlled as multiple myeloma can develop. Multiple myeloma is a form of cancer characterized by uncontrolled growth in a specific group of bone marrow cells called plasma cells.\n\nAccording to Cancer in Norway, there were approximately 560 new cases of multiple myeloma in 2023, and more than 3,500 people are living with this disease. Monoclonal gammopathy is relatively common, probably prevalence is in the order of about 7 per 1000 inhabitants in Norway (approx. 40,000), mainly in people over the age of 50 (source: [Tidsskrift for den norske legeforening](https://tidsskriftet.no/2021/09/klinisk-oversikt/monoklonal-gammopati-av-klinisk-betydning)).\n\n**Results**\n\nIn the period 2021-2023, approximately 135,000 protein electrophoreses were performed annually on just under 95,000 patients in Norway. There was great geographical variation in the use of protein electrophoresis during the period. Most samples were taken in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, where the rate was 70% higher than in the Northern Norway Regional Health Authority, which had the lowest rate.

According to the annual report for the national quality registry for lymphoid malignancies (2022), there is no geographical variation in the incidence of bone marrow cancer, and there is no difference in five-year survival between the referral areas. Thus, differences in disease incidence do not explain the large geographical variation in the use of protein electrophoresis.\n\n**Age and gender**\n\nBone marrow cancer rarely occurs in people under the age of 40 and the average age at diagnosis is 68. Monoclonal gammopathy mainly affects people over the age of 50.  The average age of those receiving protein electrophoresis in our data was 62 years, and the proportion of samples taken from people under the age of 40 was 14% for women and 10% for men.\n\n**Repeat samples**\n\n It is not recommended to repeat protein electrophoresis more frequently than every 8 weeks. The proportion of samples repeated at short intervals varied from just over 10% to just under 25%. There are differences in coding practices for some hospital referral areas, which means that there is some uncertainty associated with the proportion of repeated samples.",

The test is done in combination with early ultrasound to detect the chromosomal abnormalities trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) or trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). Following an amendment to the Biotechnology Act in 2020, all pregnant women are allowed to have NIPT performed. Pregnant women who are not entitled to prenatal diagnostics can have the test performed by certain private companies approved by the Norwegian Directorate of Health and must pay for the examination themselves. In that case, the test costs just over NOK 10,000.\n\nFrom 2022, NIPT became a public health service for all pregnant women aged 35 or older at due date and for pregnant women with special indications for prenatal diagnosis (Norwegian Directorate of Health). This analysis therefore only covers the years 2022 and 2023.\n\n**Results**\n\nAbout 12,600 pregnant women (all age groups) had NIPT performed annually in the public health service, which means that NIPT was performed in about 25% of all pregnancies. The proportion of pregnancies where NIPT was performed increased from 2022 to 2023, which may be due to the health authorities taking time to introduce the practice. It is also possible that demand increased because pregnant women became aware of the offer. Some pregnant women who were not offered NIPT through the public health service paid to have it done by private companies. Figures for this are not included in this analysis. \n\n<u>Pregnant women aged 35 years and older</u>\n\nThe proportion of pregnant women aged 35 years and older who received NIPT increased from just under 70% nationally in 2022 to just under 80% in 2023. For all but one hospital referral area, the proportion of pregnant women in this age group who had NIPT performed was between 60-80%. The proportion was lowest for residents of Nord-Trøndelag hospital referral area, where 40% of pregnant women in this age group had NIPT performed. Most hospital referral areas saw an increase in the proportion of NIPT tests from 2022 to 2023. In 2023, Diakonhjemmet had the highest proportion of NIPT tests, at around 90%, while Nord-Trøndelag's proportion was still around 40%. The differences between the hospital referral areas with the highest and lowest proportion therefore increased during the period. \n\n<u>Pregnant women aged 18-33 years</u>\n\n\nNIPT is taken when the pregnant woman is approximately 12 weeks pregnant, and many who are 34 years old when NIPT is taken will turn 35 before their due date and are therefore entitled to NIPT through public health services. It was not possible to link data on the pregnant woman's due date with data on NIPT, and it was therefore not possible to distinguish between pregnant women who turned 35 before the expected date of birth and pregnant women who were still 34 on their due date. We have therefore excluded pregnant women aged 34 years and looked at pregnant women aged 18-33 years at the time of sampling to say something about the extent of NIPT for pregnant women with special medical or social grounds for having this test performed. \n\nFor all but one of the hospital referral areas, the proportion of pregnant women in the 18-33 age group who had NIPT performed increased significantly from 2022 to 2023. The proportion of pregnant women aged 18-33 who underwent NIPT was twice as high in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority as in the Central Norway Regional Health Authority in 2023. The volume for this patient group is small, which increases the likelihood of random variation. However, it is likely that there is variation in the use of NIPT for pregnant women with special medical or social reasons for having this test performed. This may be due to pregnant women requesting the test to different degrees, or because the offer to pregnant women is not equal.",

These hormones help to regulate the cells' metabolism, and the TSH and free T4 tests are taken to diagnose and control metabolic disease. Metabolic tests are among the most frequently ordered tests, as metabolic disease can manifest as fatigue or lethargy - symptoms that many patients present to their GPs with. \n\n**Results**\n\nIn the period 2021-2023, approximately 3 million TSH tests were performed annually on 1.9 million patients in Norway. The prescription register shows that around 250,000 people used medication for metabolic disease, approximately the same number as reported by the Norwegian Metabolism Association. This means that around 13% of those who had a TSH test had a disease that required medical treatment. There was considerable geographical variation in the use of TSH tests during the period. \n\nMost samples were taken in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, where the rate was 40% higher than in the Northern Norway Regional Health Authority, which had the lowest rate. Annually, 65% more samples were taken from residents in Østfold hospital referral area compared with Finnmark hospital referral area.\n\nIf all hospital referral areas had the same rate as Østfold, about 520,000 additional samples would be taken nationally each year, which corresponds to an increase of almost 20%. If all hospital referral areas had the same rate as Finnmark, 850,000 fewer samples would be taken each year, or a reduction in reimbursements of NOK 19 million. \n\n**TSH and free T4**\n\nAccording to the Choosing Wisely campaign, routine testing of both TSH and free T4 should be avoided when screening for thyroid disease and monitoring and following up diagnosed hypothyroidism, as TSH alone is sufficient in most cases. \n\nIn the period 2021-2023, TSH was taken alone in only 17% of the samples. This means that TSH and T4 were taken simultaneously on most occasions. There was great variation between the referral areas, with the proportion of samples with only TSH varying from 1% to 35%.  The proportion of samples with only TSH increased slightly in 2023, which is positive, but the proportion of samples where T4 and TSH are taken at the same time should still be reduced considerably.\n\n**Repeat samples**\n\nAbout 10% of the TSH samples taken were repeat samples taken at intervals of less than 6 weeks, i.e. approximately 280,000 samples are taken per year less than 6 weeks after the patient's last TSH test.",

When monitoring treatment for vitamin D deficiency, it is recommended that a new sample is taken at an interval of at least 3-4 months after starting treatment or changing dose. There is little vitamin D in the normal diet (found in oily fish, egg yolk, cheese). Sunlight on the skin is our most important source of vitamin D. It is therefore recommended to take supplements in the form of cod liver oil or tablets during the winter months. \n\n**Results**\n\nIn the period 2021-2023, approximately 2 million vitamin D tests were performed annually on just under 1.5 million patients in Norway. In other words, far more patients were tested than there are indications for. More than 10% of the vitamin D samples taken are repeat samples taken at intervals of less than 12 weeks, which means that more than 210,000 samples per year are taken too soon after the last sample.\n\nThe number of vitamin D samples varied considerably. Most samples were taken in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, where the rate was 65% higher than in the Northern Norway Regional Health Authority, which had the lowest rate. 2.3 times as many samples per 1,000 population were taken annually from residents in Østfold hospital referral area compared with Finnmark hospital referral area.

The vitamin is only found in animal foods and a diet without or with only small amounts of meat, fish, eggs and milk is therefore associated with cobalamin deficiency. The use of antacid drugs and surgery in the stomach or the last part of the small intestine predispose to a lack of absorption of the vitamin. The incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency increases with age. Vitamin B12 deficiency leads to an accumulation of methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine. These are therefore considered metabolic markers of vitamin B12 deficiency (source: The Norwegian Medical Association).\n\n**Results**\n\nIn the period 2021-2023, just under 2.4 million vitamin B12 tests were performed annually on 1.7 million patients in Norway. The number of B12 samples per capita varied considerably between hospital referral areas. The highest number of samples per capita was taken in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, where the rate was over 40% higher than in the Northern Norway Regional Health Authority, which had the lowest rate. \n\n1.7 times as many samples per 1,000 inhabitants were taken annually from residents in Østfold hospital referral area compared with Finnmark hospital referral area. If all hospital referral areas had the same rate as Finnmark, the number of B12 samples would have been reduced by 800,000 per year. This would have resulted in a reduction in reimbursements from Helfo of approximately NOK 22 million per year. \n\n**Age and gender**\n\nEach year, approximately 30% of the female population aged 20-50 took B12 at least once. The corresponding figure for men was approximately 15%. The gender differences evened out after the age of 75, at the same time as the proportion of the population who had B12 measured rose to over 50%. \n\n**Repeat samples**\n\nAbout 7% of the B12 samples taken were repeat samples taken at intervals of less than 8 weeks, meaning that approximately 165,000 samples per year are taken less than 8 weeks after the patient's last B12 measurement. For many patients, it is unnecessary to repeat the measurement of B12 after a short time.",

Natriuretic peptide hormones are found in the heart muscle and are normally secreted in small amounts into the bloodstream. NT-proBNP is an inactive metabolite that has a longer half-life in plasma and is more stable than the active BNP. BNP is produced in increased amounts when the heart muscles are subjected to increased stress, such as in heart failure.

Iron deficiency can lead to anemia and iron excess can lead to iron in internal organs (hemochromatosis) and, in rare cases, damage to these organs. Iron deficiency anemia is a relatively common condition, especially in fertile women, children and elderly men and can be caused by poor diet, but also underlying disease. Ferritin is a large protein that acts as a store for iron atoms (Fe3+). Low values therefore indicate an iron deficiency, while high values usually indicate an iron surplus (hemochromatosis). However, the protein is also an acute phase protein and can be released and give high values in response to inflammatory diseases. \n\n**Results**\n\nIn each of the years 2021-2023, one third of the population had at least one outpatient ferritin test performed. There was great geographical variation in the number of ferritin tests.

The gender differences evened out in the older age groups. \n\n**Repeated samples**\n\nAbout 9% of the HbA1c samples taken were repeated samples taken at intervals of less than 8 weeks, i.e. approximately 218,000 samples are taken per year less than 8 weeks after the patient's last HbA1c test.",

LD is therefore of little diagnostic use, but is used as a tumor marker and to monitor the effect of treatment.\n\n**Results**\n\nIn the period 2021-2023, just over 400,000 LD tests were performed annually on approximately 300,000 patients in Norway. There was considerable variation between hospital referral areas in the number of LD tests per 1,000 inhabitants. Most samples were taken in the Western Norway Regional Health Authority, where the rate was 30% higher than in the Central Norway Regional Health Authority, which had the lowest rate. During the period 2021-2023, three times more samples per 1,000 population were taken annually from residents in Telemark hospital referral area compared with St. Olav's hospital referral area. For the Telemark hospital referral area, fewer samples were taken per 1,000 inhabitants in 2023 than in 2021, while the rate for St. Olav's was relatively stable. The geographical variation was therefore somewhat smaller towards the end of the period. \n\nIf all hospital referral areas had had the same rate as Telemark, twice as many LD samples would have been taken, which corresponds to just over 400,000 extra samples annually. This would have led to an increase in reimbursement from Helfo of approximately NOK 2.1 million per year. \n\n**Age and gender**\n\nApproximately 4% of female 20-year-olds had their LD measured, while the corresponding figure for men was approximately 2%. The proportion who had LD measured was higher in the older age groups, and for the population over 75, the proportion was over 10%.",

            "resultat": "**What is lactose intolerance?**\n\nThe main carbohydrate in milk is the disaccharide lactose (milk sugar). Lactose must be split in two (galactose and glucose) before it can be absorbed by the intestinal cells. This cleavage is catalyzed by the enzyme lactase. The enzyme is encoded by a gene, which in turn is regulated by another gene that can lead to reduced lactase activity over time. \n\nYoung adults can lose the ability to digest lactose. There are large ethnic differences in the prevalence of this downregulation gene - among Northern Europeans the prevalence is 5-15%, while it is up to 90% in adults in South America, Africa and Asia. \n\n**Results**\n\nIn the period 2021-2023, approximately 66,000 tests were performed annually on approximately 65,000 patients in Norway.\n\nThe number of lactose intolerance tests per 1,000 inhabitants varied greatly between hospital referral areas. Most samples were taken in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, where the rate was almost twice as high as in the other regions. During the period 2021-2023, almost nine times as many samples per 1,000 population were taken annually from residents in the OUS hospital referral area compared with the Møre og Romsdal hospital referral area. The reimbursement for the test is approximately NOK 225 from Helfo, which is a relatively high amount compared with other tests. Because the reimbursement is high, variations in the number of tests per 1,000 inhabitants will lead to major differences in the use of healthcare resources\n\nIt is known that there are major ethnic differences in the prevalence of lactose intolerance, and the proportion of inhabitants with an immigrant background varies in the different hospital referral areas. Approximately 25% of the population in Oslo have an immigrant background where lactose intolerance is a frequent occurrence. For Møre og Romsdal, this proportion is approximately 8% (Statistics Norway). Different proportions of the population with an immigrant background cannot explain all the geographical variation in lactose intolerance, but it is probably part of the explanation for the differences. At the same time, it is questionable whether it is necessary to test for lactose intolerance if a person has a background from South America, Africa or Asia, where the prevalence of lactose intolerance is around 90%, and also has symptoms of lactose intolerance. \n\n**Age and gender**\n\nThe test was most frequently performed on children and young adults, and the proportion of the female population who were tested for lactose intolerance was about twice as large as the proportion of the male population. Lactose intolerance tests were performed on 58,000 patients in 2018.  Of these patients, 8,775 had the same test repeated in the period 2018-2023. .",

However, such information , for example in the form of diagnosis codes (ICD-10 or ICPC-2), is not included in the reporting to Helfo.\n\nIn order to implement targeted and effective measures to reduce geographical variation, it is very useful to know what proportion of tests are ordered by hospital doctors, GPs or other groups of healthcare professionals. This information is voluntary to provide when submitting reimbursement claims.\n\nWe have investigated the information the laboratories have reported on the referrals and found great variation in reporting practices, both between private laboratories and hospital laboratories , but also between the various public hospital laboratories.\n\nDue to the large variation in reporting practices, information about the referrals is not used in the atlas.\n\n**Private laboratories**\n\nFor analyses from private laboratories, the information about the referrals is complete. The figure below shows that it is mainly general practitioners or out-of-hours doctors who request the tests, and that these account for 95.6 percent of the tests from private laboratories in 2023.\n\n![Number of analyses ordered from private laboratories by ordering party](/helseatlas/img/no/lab/blaa_number-of-analyses-ordered-from-private-laboratories-by-ordering-party.png)\n\nDistributed by the hospital referral areas, the proportion of tests requested by GPs/out-of-hours doctors in 2023 varied from 99.7% (Nord-Trøndelag) to 78.3% (Bergen).\n\n![Proportion of analyses ordered from private laboratories in 2023 ordered by GPs/OOH services.

Half of the submitted reimbursement claims from hospitals lacked information about the referrer. Approximately 30% of the reimbursement claims were requested by a GP/emergency doctor or the specialist health service. The remaining 20% were distributed among various other categories.\n\n![Proportion of analyses ordered from public laboratories in 2023, broken down by who ordered the tests and the patient's place of residence. Grouped by hospital referral area](/healthatlas/img/no/lab/blaa_proportion-of-requested-analyses-from-public-laboratories-2023-distributed-by-requester.png)\n\n\nThe variation in the registration of the referrals by hospital referral area is large.  For all hospital referral areas, the proportion of samples requested by GPs/out-of-hours doctors is greater than the proportion from the specialist health service. For the hospital referral areas in the Northern Norway Regional Health Authority, there is a low proportion of samples that lack information about the referrer. The vast majority of samples for residents in the Northern Norway Regional Health Authority are requested by GPs/out-of-hours doctors or the specialist health service and a small proportion fall into the category \"other services\". In the hospital referral areas of Bergen and Østfold, the majority of tests fall into the “other services” category, which suggests that variation in registration practice.  In some hospital referral areas, a significant proportion of tests are also reported to have been requested by the patient themselves. This is probably a result of incorrect registrations. "

For medical biochemistry, there are 16 reimbursement categories, MB0-MB15. Each reimbursement category is associated with one reimbursement rate. The laboratory has the opportunity to assess whether the requested analyses respond to the clinical problem in the referral, and can therefore answer more or fewer analyses than specifically requested. The reimbursement claim is sent to Helfo.\n\nReimbursement to public laboratories is paid to the regional health authority that owns the institution. If the health institution is not owned by a regional health authority, or if it is a private laboratory, it is paid directly to the institution in question. \n\nLaboratory analyses that are funded through performance-based funding (ISF) are not included in this scheme. This means that they will not be found in the KUHR database with submitted reimbursement claims. This applies to:\n\n1) patients who are hospitalized, and \n\n2) a selection of analyses carried out for patients who receive outpatient care in hospitals. \n\nThe selected analyses are marked with an asterisk in the NLK coding system, which means that the stated reimbursement category and reimbursement amount do not apply when the analysis is performed in connection with outpatient health care. \n\nThe laboratory tests that are taken and analyzed at the offices of GPs and emergency services are financed through the normal tariff. In the normal tariff, separate tariffs are stated for the laboratory analyses that are most often taken and analyzed in the office. Claims for reimbursement are submitted to the Norwegian government through Helfo.\n\nAccording to the ISF regulations, health services performed within the framework of operating agreements between the Regional Health Authorities and private specialists under the public funded contracts are not included in the calculation basis for the ISF scheme. This means that if the private specialist requests or takes blood samples that are submitted for analysis, the laboratory will be reimbursed in the usual way. This means that samples taken in connection with an appointment with a specialist are included in our data material and are included in the results.",

In practice, it is the individual health authorities and private actors who have an agreement with a regional health authority that offer and perform the health services. Each health trust has a referral area that includes specific municipalities and districts.
