          "tekst": "Main Findings\n\n* In the period 2018-2022, only 14% of patients received standard\n  rehabilitation after an acute myocardial infarction in Norway, despite\n  well-documented effects of cardiac rehabilitation.\n* Approximately one out of every four patients received standard\n  rehabilitation, learning and mastery courses (LMC), or training in specialist\n  health services after an acute myocardial infarction. The percentage receiving\n  rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction was significantly lower for\n  patients aged 65 and older.·   \n\n* There was significant and unwarranted geographical variation in the use\n  of rehabilitation after a heart attack. For those who received rehabilitation,\n  the extent, content, organization, and time after the infarction when\n  rehabilitation started varied. \n*  The number of elderly (75 years and older) admitted with acute myocardial\n  infarction has decreased, despite an increase in the elderly population. \n* There was little geographical variation in the number of patients\n  admitted with acute myocardial infarction per 1,000 inhabitants, excluding the\n  areas with the highest and lowest rates.· \n* There was moderate geographical variation in revascularization rates for\n  the elderly (75 years and older), and little variation for the general\n  population (18 years and older).\n* As in 2013-2015, there was no correlation between admission for acute myocardial\n  infarction and revascularization of the heart for the elderly (75 years and\n  older). For all adults (18 years and older), the correlation was moderate.\n  There were greater geographical variations in treatment practices for the\n  elderly than for all adults combined."
