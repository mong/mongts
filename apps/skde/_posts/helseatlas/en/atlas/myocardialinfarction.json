The percentage receiving\n  rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction was significantly lower for\n  patients aged 65 and older.·   \n\n* There was significant and unwarranted geographical variation in the use\n  of rehabilitation after a heart attack. For those who received rehabilitation,\n  the extent, content, organization, and time after the infarction when\n  rehabilitation started varied. \n*  The number of elderly (75 years and older) admitted with acute myocardial\n  infarction has decreased, despite an increase in the elderly population. \n* There was little geographical variation in the number of patients\n  admitted with acute myocardial infarction per 1,000 inhabitants, excluding the\n  areas with the highest and lowest rates.· \n* There was moderate geographical variation in revascularization rates for\n  the elderly (75 years and older), and little variation for the general\n  population (18 years and older).\n* As in 2013-2015, there was no correlation between admission for acute myocardial\n  infarction and revascularization of the heart for the elderly (75 years and\n  older). For all adults (18 years and older), the correlation was moderate.\n  There were greater geographical variations in treatment practices for the\n  elderly than for all adults combined."

A myocardial infarction is a serious condition that develops\nquickly. It is therefore important to start treatment early.\n\nEach year, just under\n11,000 Norwegians suffer from an acute myocardial infarction, with an annual\ndecrease of about 3% since 2015 (Annual Report 202, Norwegian Myocardial\ninfarction Register). In about 25% of patients, one of the coronary arteries is\ncompletely blocked, often due to a rupture in the surface of a narrow part of\nthe blood vessel and the formation of a thrombus (blood clot). In the remaining\n75% of myocardial infarction, there are minor ECG changes, and the coronary\nartery is usually not completely blocked.\n\nIn Norway, there are no\nspecific guidelines for rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction, and the\nEuropean guidelines are followed (Ambrosetti et al. 2020 and Visseren et al.\n2021), as well as the National Professional Guideline for the Prevention of\nCardiovascular Disease (Norwegian Directorate of Health)."
