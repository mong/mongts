The percentage receiving\n  rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction was significantly lower for\n  patients aged 65 and older.·   \n\n* There was significant and unwarranted geographical variation in the use\n  of rehabilitation after a heart attack. For those who received rehabilitation,\n  the extent, content, organization, and time after the infarction when\n  rehabilitation started varied. \n*  The number of elderly (75 years and older) admitted with acute myocardial\n  infarction has decreased, despite an increase in the elderly population. \n* There was little geographical variation in the number of patients\n  admitted with acute myocardial infarction per 1,000 inhabitants, excluding the\n  areas with the highest and lowest rates.· \n* There was moderate geographical variation in revascularization rates for\n  the elderly (75 years and older), and little variation for the general\n  population (18 years and older).\n* As in 2013-2015, there was no correlation between admission for acute myocardial\n  infarction and revascularization of the heart for the elderly (75 years and\n  older). For all adults (18 years and older), the correlation was moderate.\n  There were greater geographical variations in treatment practices for the\n  elderly than for all adults combined."

A myocardial infarction is a serious condition that develops\nquickly.

In about 25% of patients, one of the coronary arteries is\ncompletely blocked, often due to a rupture in the surface of a narrow part of\nthe blood vessel and the formation of a thrombus (blood clot). In the remaining\n75% of myocardial infarction, there are minor ECG changes, and the coronary\nartery is usually not completely blocked.\n\nIn Norway, there are no\nspecific guidelines for rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction, and the\nEuropean guidelines are followed (Ambrosetti et al. 2020 and Visseren et al.\n2021), as well as the National Professional Guideline for the Prevention of\nCardiovascular Disease (Norwegian Directorate of Health)."

Rehabilitation as part of secondary preventive\ntreatment is recommended for all patients after a heart attack. Rehabilitation\nis cost-effective, improves quality of life, reduces the risk of recurrence,\ndeath, and rehospitalization. Research in the field is of the highest quality\n(class 1A) and provides clear recommendations (Visseren et al. 2021, Ambrosetti\net al. 2020).\n\n**About This Healthcare Atlas**\n\nThe Healthcare Atlas examines the cardiac rehabilitation that the patient received in the period\nfrom discharge from the hospital after an acute myocardial infarction and six\nmonths forward.\n\nActivity in specialist health services coded as rehabilitation with the codes Z50.0 Rehabilitation\nafter heart disease, Z50.80 Complex rehabilitation, Z50.89 Simple\nrehabilitation, and Z50.9 Treatment involving the use of unspecified\nrehabilitation measures is called “standard rehabilitation” in this health\natlas. The use of these codes should indicate that the activity is targeted,\nplanned, and interdisciplinary. See more about code quality under the\ndiscussion of the method.\n\nTo get a broader picture of the services offered to patients in the first six months after the\ninfarction, we supplemented analyses of standard rehabilitation after a myocardial\ninfarction with participation in Learning and Mastery Courses (LMS courses) and\ntraining in specialist health services, and training with a physiotherapist\nwith municipal operating grants / who has billed Helfo. That the health\nservices for patients vary geographically in terms of content, duration, and\norganization is also evident from feedback from the field.\n\nBased on the Myocardial infarction Register’s definition of cardiac rehabilitation; “education on how to reduce the risk of a new myocardial infarction and the offer of physical\ntraining” (Annual Report 2022), we understand that participation in LMS courses\nand training is part of cardiac rehabilitation, and including LMS courses and\ntraining for more pragmatic reasons seems natural. To what extent such services\nmeet the conditions for achieving rehabilitation results, which are the basis\nfor the guidelines (Visseren et al. 2021), is not available through the data we\nhave."

          "tekst": "\nThe analysis results of cardiac rehabilitation will be influenced by how we understand the concept of rehabilitation, what data and methods we have used in the analyses, and the\nquality of the registered data.\n\n**Definitions and Operationalization of the Concept of Rehabilitation**\n\nThe definition of rehabilitation can vary in different contexts. Here we briefly mention the understanding of cardiac rehabilitation that this health atlas is based on:\n\n“The sum of activities and interventions necessary to ensure physical, mental, and social conditions so that patients with chronic or post-acute heart disease can return to their\nprevious place in society and live an active life” (Helsebiblioteket).\n\nFurther on the content of rehabilitation: “Cardiac rehabilitation consists of complex, long-term programs involving medical evaluation, prescription of physical activity, reduction of\nrisk factors, education, and psychosocial support. The programs are carried out\nby a multidisciplinary team with a minimum of 4 different professional groups\nfor simple rehabilitation and a minimum of 6 different professional groups for\ncomplex rehabilitation” (Helsebiblioteket).\n\nThe European guidelines, which are supported in Norway, recommend that multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation should include exercise, education, follow-up, and management of\nlifestyle and risk factors, as well as psychosocial support (Visseren et al. 2021).\n\nThe analyses of standard rehabilitation in the health atlas are based on data from the Norwegian Patient Register (NPR). The regulations for activity-based funding (ISF regulations\n2022, chapter 6.12) set requirements for the use of rehabilitation codes,\nincluding the number of professional groups that must be involved. The concept\nof rehabilitation is thus operationalized through activity-based funding (ISF),\nwhile funding is linked to rehabilitation activities that meet the requirements\nand are correctly coded.\n\n**Quality of Rehabilitation Coding**\n\nThe main data source for the analyses of rehabilitation in the health atlas is the Norwegian Patient Register (NPR), a national health register containing information about all\npatients who have received rehabilitation in specialist health services in\nNorway, both public health services and private ones with agreements with the\npublic sector. NPR is primarily developed for administrative purposes. In the\nhealth atlas, the information is used to assess whether there is geographical\nvariation in rehabilitation in the six months after patients were acutely\nadmitted with a heart attack.\n\nA challenge related to the analysis of this type of data is whether the coding quality is good enough. Errors or omissions in coding will result in inaccuracies in describing\nrehabilitation in specialist health services. Much has been done to improve and\nharmonize coding practices, but we cannot rule out that there are some errors\nor omissions in our dataset, meaning the data may not fully reflect the actual\nactivities performed.\n\nThe Norwegian Directorate of Health comments on the quality of rehabilitation coding in general in the report “Rehabilitation in Specialist Health Services 2017-2021”. They mention\nthat there may be underreporting of outpatient and day rehabilitation but have\nnot investigated the extent of this or how it manifests. Stays have previously\nbeen incorrectly registered as inpatient stays instead of a series of\noutpatient contacts in some health trusts (Annual Reports from 2019 and 2021,\nSettlement Committee).\n\nThe Norwegian Directorate of Health also mentions in the report that in recent years more private providers have reported to NPR, but there is still uncertainty in the coding. Analyses of\nday and outpatient activities related to private rehabilitation institutions\nshould therefore be interpreted with caution.\n\nTo minimize the challenge of coding errors, including the procedure codes and tariff codes we have used, we have spent time preparing and quality-checking the datasets from NPR and KPR,\nfamiliarizing ourselves with the coding rules, and talking to professionals\nabout the coding of activities. We have assessed that the results contain as\nfew errors as possible based on the available data.\n\n**Cohort Analysis**\n\nIn the Health Atlas for Heart Attack, we used cohort analysis where we followed patients with acute myocardial infarction from discharge after the myocardial infarction for the first six\nmonths forward, examining participation in rehabilitation during this period.\n\nWe used a narrower definition of patients with myocardial infarction in the analyses related to rehabilitation (I21 acute myocardial infarction as the main condition) than in the analysis of\nadmissions with myocardial infarction(I21 acute heart attack, or I22 subsequent\nheart attack, as the main or secondary condition). The analyses of admissions\nwith myocardial infarction are an update of analyses in the Elderly Health\nAtlas, and we have therefore used the same codes as in the Elderly Health\nAtlas. By using a strict definition in the analyses of rehabilitation after an\nacute heart attack, we are more confident that we include the correct patient\ngroup. We saw in the data from NPR that most of the rehabilitation occurred\nafter inpatient stays with I21 (acute heart attack) as the main condition, and\nnot after stays with I22 (subsequent heart attack), or where the codes were\nused as secondary conditions. The ICD-10 codes for acute myocardial infarction have\nbeen found to be of good quality (Varmdal et al. 2021).\n\nWe found that 75% of\nrehabilitation episodes were completed within the first six months. Extending\nthe period would have resulted in slightly more episodes. On the other hand, a\ncohort analysis over a longer period would entail greater uncertainty regarding\nwhether the rehabilitation was related to the heart attack.\n\n**Need for Guidelines and Quality Indicators**\n\nThe geographical variation in cardiac rehabilitation, based on our analyses and information from professionals from different parts of the country, appears to be supply-driven\nrather than need-driven. We find areas in Norway with a high prevalence of heart\nattacks, such as Finnmark, where the provision and use of cardiac\nrehabilitation are limited. We would characterize the geographical variation as\nundesirable, despite the caveat about coding quality. The analyses show an\nunderuse of rehabilitation after heart attacks, and there is a need for\nmeasures to improve the service offering for patients after heart attacks.\n\nTo achieve a more equitable rehabilitation service regardless of where one lives, it seems there is a need for national guidelines for rehabilitation after heart attacks - and that\neffective rehabilitation services are established for patients across the\ncountry. The work on guidelines started in 2023. Specific quality indicators\ncould also be measures to improve the extent and quality of services."

          "resultat": "14% of patients received standard rehabilitation after an acute heart attack. This is a very low percentage - for both genders and all age groups -\ncompared to the guidelines that recommend rehabilitation for all with coronary\nheart disease (Visseren et al. 2021).\n\nThere was significant geographical variation in the percentage who received follow-up with standard rehabilitation after an acute heart attack. Both the ratio between, and the\nsystematic variation component for, the catchment areas with the second highest\nand second lowest percentage of rehabilitation were high (FT2=9.3 and SCV2=45).\nRatios and systematic variation components are used to support the assessment\nof geographical variation. Patients from the Vestfold catchment area had the\nhighest likelihood of receiving standard rehabilitation, with 41% receiving\nsuch follow-up on average per year in 2018-2022. In nine of the catchment\nareas, 5% or fewer received standard rehabilitation after an acute heart\nattack.\n\nThere were regional differences in the use of standard rehabilitation, with the lowest percentage participation in Northern Norway (4%) and the highest in Southeastern Norway\n(16%).\n\nWithin the catchment areas of the health trusts in the same health region, the use of standard\nrehabilitation also varied. In Southeastern Norway, the Vestfold catchment area\nhad the highest percentage receiving such rehabilitation, while the Østfold and\nTelemark catchment areas had the lowest in the country. Similarly, within\nWestern Norway; high participation rates in the Bergen area, and low in the\nStavanger area. In Central Norway, the percentage was systematically highest\nfor patients from the Møre og Romsdal catchment area.\n\n\n\n![](/helseatlas/img/en/myocardialinfarction/prosentdel_rehab__eng.png \"Distribution of percentages of rehabilitation by age and sex groups during 2018-2022\")\n\nThe extent of the use of standard rehabilitation varied greatly. In the OUS catchment area, an average of 15 episodes per patient was registered, and for Norway, 6.5 episodes per patient for those who received standard rehabilitation. In some catchment areas, very few rehabilitation episodes per patient were registered, which could indicate a limited service offering but also raise suspicion of inadequate coding of standard rehabilitation after an acute heart attack. The report “Rehabilitation in Specialist Health Services 2017-2021” also mentions that there may be underreporting of diagnosis codes for rehabilitation (z-codes) in day and outpatient clinics in hospitals. \n\nThere were differences in the type of standard rehabilitation, based on how the activities were coded. For Norway as a whole, most of the activity was outpatient rehabilitation, registered with Z50.9. That cardiac rehabilitation mainly occurs on an outpatient basis corresponds with professionals’ descriptions of the field. \n\nThe code for rehabilitation after heart disease, Z50.0, was rarely used, with a few exceptions (Fonna, Stavanger, Finnmark, and UNN areas). The reason for this has not been investigated. That the analyses in the health atlas are based on a broader set of codes than just Z50.0 seems essential when highlighting cardiac rehabilitation. \n\nIn several areas with a low percentage of standard rehabilitation after an acute heart attack, including the Helgeland and Østfold catchment areas, much of the activity occurred as inpatient stays, coded with Z50.80 (complex rehabilitation) and Z50.89 (simple rehabilitation). \n\nThere were more episodes coded with Z50.80 or Z50.89 in Northern Norway than in other regions. This finding indicates relatively greater use of inpatient stays in the region, which seems likely due to long travel distances for participation in outpatient or day rehabilitation. \n\n\n\n\n![](/helseatlas/img/en/myocardialinfarction/rplot_zkodar_en.png \"Distribution of Z-codes in standard rehabilitation by Hospital referral areas during 2018-2022\")\n\n\n\n\nThe number of days before the start of standard rehabilitation after an acute myocardial infarction also varied. There was a tendency for earlier start with standard rehabilitation in central areas of Eastern Norway and later start after a myocardial infarction in the north of the country. About half of the patients from the Diakonhjemmet (Oslo West) and Vestfold catchment areas started standard rehabilitation one month after discharge from the acute stay, while in the Stavanger and Nordland areas, about half started only after four months. For Norway (red line), half of the patients had started standard rehabilitation after 53 days. \n\nThe analyses concerning standard rehabilitation are based on codes for rehabilitation (z-codes). There are explicit requirements for a service to be called rehabilitation and to use such a rehabilitation code. Among other things, a plan must be developed for each patient, and several professional groups must be involved (see ISF regulations 2022). Although some of the explanation for the low use of standard rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction may be due to underreporting of z-diagnosis codes, it still seems that standard rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction is a limited service offering in Norway. The impression of a limited service offering for standard cardiac rehabilitation in Norway is also supported by contact with professionals. \n\n![](/helseatlas/img/en/myocardialinfarction/standarddagartil15.png \"Days to the first rehabilitation episode after discharge\")\n\n\n\n\nThe number of days before the start of standard rehabilitation after an acute myocardial infarction also varied.

          "resultat": "\n\n\n68% of patients with acute myocardial infarction were men. The average age for men was 68 years and for women 74 years. \n\n26% of patients received rehabilitation after an acute myocardial infarction if we included both standard rehabilitation, participation in learning and mastery courses (LMS courses), and training in specialist health services in the analyses. In the pandemic year 2020, the percentage was lowest. In only a few catchment areas was rehabilitation back to a “pre-pandemic level” in 2021. The low level of cardiac rehabilitation in 2020 was mainly due to the shutdown associated with the pandemic (Norwegian Directorate of Health 2022). \n\nParticipation in rehabilitation varied from 9% to 46% between the catchment areas of the health trusts, and few patients from Finnmark received rehabilitation, despite a high prevalence of heart attacks. The highest percentage was in the catchment areas with the largest cities. The geographical variation can be characterized as systematic and large (FT2=4.5 and SCV2=23.4). \n\nA similar extent of participation in rehabilitation was also revealed in a study of cardiac rehabilitation after first-time PCI (Olsen et al. 2018). Of those who participated in the study (82% of all with first-time PCI in 2008-2011), 28% had participated in cardiac rehabilitation. The study found similar trends to our analyses, also in geographical variation with the lowest participation in cardiac rehabilitation in Northern Norway and the highest in Southeastern Norway. Although both the patient sample, follow-up time (3 years versus our 6 months), and use of different methods (they questionnaires, we data from NPR), their results strengthen our findings of low participation and large geographical variation in cardiac rehabilitation in Norway. \n\nThe highest percentage of patients who received rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction was found in the catchment areas of OUS, Vestfold, and Diakonhjemmet. While the Vestfold area had a relatively large percentage receiving standard rehabilitation, the two areas in Oslo had little standard rehabilitation registered, but a relatively larger proportion participating in LMC courses and training. \n\nFor patients aged 65 and older, there was a clear reduction in the percentage of patients receiving standard rehabilitation, LMC courses, and/or training after a heart attack. That heart patients in Norway who receive rehabilitation are relatively young has also been shown previously (Olsen et al. 2018). This contrasts with recommendations for rehabilitation at all ages (Ambrosetti et al. 2020). That older people are more likely to have more complex problems and different risk profiles than younger people is an argument for specialist health services to take responsibility for rehabilitation after a myocardial infarction also for the elderly. \n\nThe percentage of women (20%) who received rehabilitation was lower than for men (30%). This is also known from other analyses (Visseren et al. 2021). The fact that the women in our analyses were somewhat older than the men, and that the elderly are less likely to receive rehabilitation, may be one of the explanations for this finding. \n\n![](/helseatlas/img/en/myocardialinfarction/prosentdel_samla_kjonn_alder_englisk.png \"Distribution of percentage rehablitation after myocarial infarction by age and sex groups\")\n\n\nFor patients who received rehabilitation, the number of rehabilitation episodes they received in the first six months after an acute myocardial infarction varied geographically. For patients from the catchment areas of Helse Bergen and Sykehuset Østfold, patients received an average of 10 rehabilitation episodes, and for Norway, the average was 7. Included in these analyses are episodes of standard rehabilitation, LMS courses, and/or training in specialist health services. \n\n\n\n![](/helseatlas/img/en/myocardialinfarction/rehab_per_pasient-samla_englisk.png \"Distribution of rehabilitation episodes per patient\")\n\nMost of the rehabilitation occurred in the public sector, and for Norway as a whole, 86% of rehabilitation episodes took place there. The highest percentage of private rehabilitation was in Oslo with 71% in the OUS area, followed by 42% in the Stavanger area. \n\nIn most catchment areas, the number of rehabilitation episodes per patient was highest in the public sector. However, there were some contrasts in the country with 7 times more episodes per patient in the private sector than in the public sector in the OUS catchment area, and conversely, 9 times more episodes per patient in the public sector in the Møre og Romsdal catchment area. By private, we mean private institutions with agreements with the regional health authority. \n\n![](/helseatlas/img/en/myocardialinfarction/rehab_per_pas_samla_privatepublic.png \"Ratio of rehabilitation episodes per patient  for the public and private in each referral areas\")\n\nThe percentage distribution of types of rehabilitation measures after a heart attack; standard rehabilitation, education, and/or training, varied between different parts of the country based on the coding of activities. For Norway as a whole, only 60% of the episodes were coded as standard rehabilitation (coded with Z-codes), varying from 5% to 96% between catchment areas, and education in LMS courses accounted for 10%. \n\nPhysical training was a central part of rehabilitation after an acute heart attack. Training was either registered as individual episodes (31% of the episodes were only training), included as part of the LMS course, or included in the standard rehabilitation episode. Although training is a core component, the guidelines are clear that the effect of a cardiac rehabilitation program depends on participation in the entire interdisciplinary program, not just the physical training (Dibben et al. 2023 and Visseren et al. 2021). \n\nIn some catchment areas, standard rehabilitation was mainly coded as inpatient stays (Helgeland and Østfold). Otherwise, there appeared to be little rehabilitation after a heart attack. When we included LMS courses and training in the analyses, we found that patients still had a service offering after a heart attack. \n\nThat both the type of measures and the extent of the service offering varied geographically corresponds with results from previous studies of rehabilitation and secondary preventive measures in hospitals (Peersen et al. 2017, Peersen et al. 2021, and Olsen et al. 2018). \n\n![](/helseatlas/img/en/myocardialinfarction/prosentvis_samla.png \"Distribution of rehabilitation type by hospital referral area\")\n\nThe number of days to the start of rehabilitation (standard rehabilitation, LMS courses, and/or training) varied greatly between catchment areas. The difference was nevertheless somewhat smaller than for standard rehabilitation alone. Half of the patients in several catchment areas in Oslo and around the Oslofjord started rehabilitation about one month after discharge from the acute stay. In the catchment areas in Northern Norway and Stavanger, rehabilitation started about three months after a heart attack. For Norway (red line), half of the patients had started rehabilitation only after 50 days. This is despite the guidelines recommending starting as soon as possible after the myocardial infarction (Visseren et al. 2021). \n\n\n\n![](/helseatlas/img/en/myocardialinfarction/dagar_til_første15_eng.png \"Days to the first rehabilitation episode after discharge from myocardial infarction\")\n\nThere may be several explanations for the low participation in rehabilitation after a heart attack. It is beyond the scope of the health atlas to investigate this, but we will briefly mention some points. Referral routines, availability, travel distances, capacity, how well the service is developed, patient preferences, knowledge of existing services, and knowledge of patients needing rehabilitation may vary, as we understand from contact with professionals and as highlighted in research articles (Peersen et al. 2021, Olsen et al. 2018, and Piepoli et al. 2016). \n\nIn the latest annual report, the Myocardial infarction Register (2022) highlights that only half of those who responded to questions from the register reported that they had been referred to cardiac rehabilitation, defined as “education on how to reduce the risk of a new myocardial infarction and the offer of physical training.” There were also large regional differences in referrals, from 37% in Western Norway to 64% in Southeastern Norway, which may affect the participation rate in cardiac rehabilitation. The guidelines recommend finding methods to increase referral and participation in cardiac rehabilitation, so that as many as possible can benefit from services that have a clear health and societal benefit (Visseren et al. 2021).",
